# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project that tracks and visualizes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and time.

## Project Objectives:

* Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
* Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
* Compare metrics across countries/regions (e.g., Kenya vs. Uganda).
* Visualize trends with charts and maps.
* Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools and Libraries Used:

* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **matplotlib:** For creating static plots and visualizations.
* **plotly.express:** For creating interactive visualizations, including the choropleth map.

## How to Run/View the Project:

1.  Ensure you have a Jupyter environment (like Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels) set up.
2.  Download the COVID-19 global data (e.g., from Our World in Data).
3.  Upload the data file (e.g., a CSV file) to your Jupyter environment.
4.  Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file).
5.  Run the code cells sequentially to load, clean, analyze, and visualize the data. The output, including plots and insights, will be displayed within the notebook.
6.  The final insights and reflections are summarized in the markdown cells at the end of the notebook.
7.  The notebook can be exported to a PDF format for sharing or viewing outside the Jupyter environment (File -> Download as -> PDF via LaTeX or Print to PDF).

## Key Insights and Reflections:

* The analysis revealed the global spread of COVID-19, with varying levels of impact across different regions (as seen in the choropleth map).
* Comparing Kenya and Uganda showed differences in the total number of reported cases and the progression of their vaccination campaigns. Kenya experienced a higher cumulative case count, and its vaccination efforts appeared to have started earlier and progressed at a faster rate in terms of total doses.
* The percentage of the population vaccinated in Kenya and Uganda may also show different levels of coverage, reflecting varying stages of their vaccination rollouts relative to their populations.
* An interesting pattern observed in Kenya's vaccination data was the presence of sharp increases, potentially indicating batch reporting.

This project demonstrates the process of analyzing real-world pandemic data to understand its spread and the progress of vaccination efforts. Further analysis could delve deeper into specific factors influencing these trends and explore other regions or metrics.
